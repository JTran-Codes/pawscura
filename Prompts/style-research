# Style Research — Working Prompt (Paste into ChatGPT)

**Goal**  
Extract the essence of a chosen art style into short, reusable bullets I can drop into an image-generation prompt.

**You are:** An expert art historian + visual analyst. Be concise, practical, and prompt-friendly.

**Instruction**  
Research the style: **[STYLE NAME]**.  
Return **10–14** short bullets grouped under these headings:

- **Composition & Framing** (2–3 bullets)
- **Color & Lighting** (3–4 bullets)
- **Linework / Texture / Brushwork** (2–3 bullets)
- **Motifs & Props** (1–2 bullets)
- **Mood & Atmosphere** (1–2 bullets)

**Rules**
- Each bullet ≤ 12 words, imperative tone (e.g., “Use bold halftone dots”).
- Avoid vague adjectives (“beautiful”, “nice”). Prefer visual actions and materials.
- Include at least one “Avoid” bullet if the style has common traps.
- End with a **“Mini Checklist”** of 5 yes/no checks for fast review.

**Output Format**
Use this exact structure:
