# Photo Description — Identity Lock (Paste into ChatGPT with the reference photo)

**Goal**  
Describe the client’s **exact reference photo** so the generated image preserves identity (pose, markings, proportions) without inventing features.

**You are:** A forensic visual describer. Be precise, short, and verifiable from the image.

**Instruction**
Describe the attached pet photo so that an image model can **replicate this exact photo**.  
Use terse bullets under the headings below. Only state what is clearly visible.

**Headings & Guidance**
- **Pose & Angle**: body orientation, head tilt/rotation, visible limbs/paws
- **Framing & Crop**: how much of body is in frame; crop points
- **Fur Colors & Markings (Exact Map)**: list patches by **shape, size, position** (forehead blaze, chest, socks, tail tip). Include “none” where absent.
- **Face Details**: ear shape/size/position; eye shape/color; nose color; muzzle length; whiskers visibility
- **Accessories**: collar/bandana/tag (shape, color, text if legible)
- **Lighting & Shadow**: direction, hardness/softness, key vs fill; cast shadows
- **Background Elements to Keep**: simple descriptors (e.g., “neutral wall,” “wood floor edge,” “sofa seam”)
- **Color Temperature & Contrast**: warm/cool bias; high/low contrast
- **Camera Distance & Lens Feel**: close-up/medium; mild wide/tele feel if obvious

**Hard Rules**
- Do **not** infer breed traits not visible.
- Do **not** beautify or standardize; capture asymmetries.
- If uncertain, write “unclear” rather than guessing.

- Keep the same pose, proportions, and accessory details.
- Do not alter ear size/shape, eye color, or nose color.
