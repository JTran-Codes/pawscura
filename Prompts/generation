**Use**: Combine your style notes + identity description. Replace ALL CAPS placeholders.

Create a high-resolution illustration in the **[STYLE NAME]** aesthetic.

### STYLE NOTES (from research; keep concise)
- [STYLE BULLET 1]
- [STYLE BULLET 2]
- [STYLE BULLET 3]
- [STYLE BULLET 4]
- [STYLE BULLET 5]

### REPLICATE THIS EXACT PHOTO (identity lock; use verbatim bullets)
[PASTE the “Identity Description” section here]

### HARD RULES
- The pet must match markings, colors, pose, and proportions exactly.
- Do not invent or delete patches, stripes, or accessories.
- Preserve background elements listed under Identity Description.
- No breed change, no facial morphing, no symmetry “fixes.”

### OUTPUT INTENT
- Print-ready, clean edges, natural shadow detail
- Crisp read at thumbnail size (1–2 seconds)

### NEGATIVE PROMPTS (identity safety)
- No extra limbs/eyes; no mirrored markings
- No plastic shine or CGI look
- No gray wash; keep true blacks and warm whites if applicable
- No painterly blur unless style calls for it

### TECHNICAL EMPHASIS (hint)
- High detail; anti-aliased edges; balanced contrast
- Composition centered; subject dominance

(If the first pass misses a detail, regenerate and prepend a short note e.g.,  
“Emphasize: white blaze stops at nose; ears large and upright; collar tag hexagonal.”)
